\section{What are Drugs?}
Drugs are substances that, when introduced into the body, cause physiological effects. They can be used for medical purposes or recreational use. Drugs may alter the function of the body, treat or prevent diseases, or even alter the state of mind. 

\subsection{Types of Drugs}
There are several types of drugs, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Prescription Drugs:} These are drugs prescribed by a medical professional to treat specific conditions.
    \item \textbf{Over-the-counter (OTC) Drugs:} These can be purchased without a prescription and are commonly used to treat minor ailments.
    \item \textbf{Recreational Drugs:} These are used for pleasure rather than for medical reasons, such as alcohol and marijuana.
    \item \textbf{Illegal Drugs:} These are prohibited substances like cocaine or heroin.
    \item \textbf{Controlled Substances:} These are used to improve athletic performance, such as anabolic steroids.
    \item \textbf{Herbal and Natural Drugs:} These are derived from plants or natural sources, such as ginseng or echinacea.
    \item \textbf{Experimental or Investigational Drugs:} These are being tested for safety and efficacy in clinical trials.
